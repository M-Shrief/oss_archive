# Roadmap

- We need to provide the ability to share projects as Zip files, and maybe it'll be better when we want to distribute the files over multiple machines then we can extract them and then we can use `git pull`, and it'll be useful when we offer them on torrent. (naming convention is the same with oss.fullanme file but it's a Zip file.)
