# Roadmap

- Most likely, we'll need to download OSS as a compressed file instead of git clone - because of the slow internet and to limit the bandwidth - so we'll need to integrate `aria2` to manage this downloads. 

- We need to provize the ability to provide projects as Zip files, and maybe it'll be better when we want to distribute the files over multiple machines then we can extract them and then we can use `git pull`, and it'll be useful when we offer them on torrent. (naming convention is the same with project repo directory but it's a Zip file.)
