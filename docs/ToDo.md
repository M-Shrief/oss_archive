- Use Forgejo's [logs](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/config-cheat-sheet/#log-log) in our application
- We can add a hook, so every time we update the mirror we recompress the OSS, so that we can use torrent to share it as zip.
- when adding a new repo, we search the fullname, if an equal repo appear we show an error, and refere the user to the existing repo.
- Bulk insert, like inserting all repos in a github profile are used as a function but we don't design the database's entities/tables for that.
